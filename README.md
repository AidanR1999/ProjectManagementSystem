Welcome to the Project Management App wiki!

It's a coursework management app made in Nodejs with help from express and some other cool libraries.

Current version is hosted at: [domore.space](https://domore.space) 
We chose to host it on digital ocean VPS, with Ubuntu running Nginx as a reliable web server. 

To install and use locally you will need Node and npm.

NOTE: Link sharing feature will only work on the above hosted domain. This feature allows the user to generate a link for others to view their existing project.

Our app allows students to create / edit and manage listings of coursework including:

* title
* module name
* due date
* and milestones

Coursework can also be rearranged by drag and drop using the handlebars. 

App has all the usual basic functionality such as user accounts (login/register), encrypted passwords, sessions, database and makes use of number of various libraries. 

Unit tests for DatabaseAO is on test.js. Run node test.js on terminal.

Group Report can be found in Group Report folder in master branch.
