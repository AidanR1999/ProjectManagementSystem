Welcome to the Project Management App wiki!

It's a coursework management app made in Nodejs with help from express and some other cool libraries.

Current version is hosted at: [domore.space](https://domore.space) 
We chose to host it on digital ocean VPS, with Ubuntu running Nginx as a reliable web server. 

To install and use locally you will need Node and npm.

Our app allows students to create / edit and manage listings of coursework including:

* title
* module name
* due date
* and milestones

Coursework can also be rearranged by drag and drop using the handlebars. 

App has all the usual basic functionality such as user accounts (login/register), encrypted passwords, sessions, database and makes use of number of various libraries.
